Change from local development environment (modified from GitHub)
Change from GitHub

I got some practice using git. The thing I learned most is that resolving merge conflicts is not fun to do,
so I plan to avoid that in future projects, if possible. When collaborating with other people, it is 
important to communicate with each other to make the development process easier. I hope that I can better 
learn how to use Git and GitHub to facilitate my code writing.
