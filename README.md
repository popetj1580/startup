## Elevator Pitch

My website will display a list of motivational quotes. A user can add a quote to the page by placing the quote into the text box at the top of the page. Once they enter the quote and click on the submit button, their quote will be added to the webpage. Then, users can read the list of quotes below by scrolling down.

(I tried to render the image with Markdown, but it doesn't seem to like using Google drive share links...)

## Startup Learnings

### HTML

The HTML for this webpage was pretty simple and straightforward. Once I learned which element types I needed, it was just a matter of putting them in. Overall, it only took a few minutes to put all the HTML on the page the way I wanted it to look

### CSS

Getting the CSS to work how I wanted was a little bit more complicated. It took me a while to make the list of quotes take up the entire page, but I finally got it to work once I made the html and body elements take up 100% of the vertical space. Now that the CSS is done, I am very happy with how my page looks, including the changes with respect to screen size.

### Javascript

The javascript that I put in was not too hard to figure out once I found the appropriate references within the Simon JS. One thing I found out with implementing the JS was that I didn't like some of what was happening with the CSS once I added enough quotes to the list to make the page require a scroll bar. I had to make a few tweaks to the CSS to make myself happier with the output. That goes to show how integrated the three technologies of HTML, CSS, and Javascript are.
