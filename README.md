## Elevator Pitch

My website will display a list of motivational quotes. A user can add a quote to the page by placing the quote into the text box at the top of the page. Once they enter the quote and click on the submit button, their quote will be added to the webpage. Then, users can read the list of quotes below by scrolling down.
